## Your Web Application Title
Include a very brief summary of your project here. Be sure to include the CSS positioning technique you used, and any required instructions to use your application.

## Technical Achievements
- **Single-page app**: The submission and display of data is all handled in a single page, showing the current state of server-side data in the table.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Using the think-aloud protocol to test interface**: 

1. Provide the last name of each student you conduct the evaluation with.
OConnor

2. What problems did the user have with your design?
The user was confused by the "days left" field, having entered a date extremely far in the future, which led to a value that had to be expressed in scientific notation.

3. What comments did they make that surprised you?
I was surprised by how usable the remove button was, given that it requires the user to match both the name and the date of the task to be removed.

4. What would you change about the interface based on their feedback?
I would definitely include some instructions on the page for the use of the remove button, as well as modify the calculations for "days left" so that it cannot output numbers in scientific notation (I could potentially make the column "Time until due" and include, say "3 years" as a value).
