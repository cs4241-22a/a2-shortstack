## TODO App

https://a2-gabestuf.glitch.me/

My TODO app lets users create a list of things they need to do with a title, description, and location. I used flexbox mostly because it's easy to center the items. Simply type a title, description, and location and click add to add the item to the list. Hit the delete button to delete an item from the list.

## Technical Achievements

- **Single Page App**: I make a get request on page load and then use the data to render a table of the information. Every time the table is updated (adding or deleting rows), the response from the request contains the new data which is re-rendered.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements

- **Test App with Other Students**:

1. Mulcahey
2. Buttons looked bad, no hover effects
3. He liked it
4. I styled the buttons better by adding hover effects
