## Contact Book

https://a2-yasmineaoua.glitch.me

This project is a website for storing contacts. I used justify-content to position my content in the center of the page.

Instructions for use:
- enter text into the first name, last name textboxes
- enter a 10 digit phone number into the phone number textbox
- either type in a date or select the calendar icon and click the month and year at the top to select a different one for the birthday
- click submit when you are done

- to delete a row in the table click its corresponding delete button

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I have a one page application by rendering the table underneath the html form after receiving a response to the submit or delete requests. 

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: I conducted two user studies (attached in user_studies folder)
Study 1: Lin
This user had a few problems with the readability of some of the data displayed (like phone number) and the lack of a modify functionality. I was a bit surprised about the date format being confusing because I had been working with it so I understood that it was changing the format behind the scenes but it makes sense that it could be confusing to the user. I would do more processing of the data submitted to improve the readability of the data displayed in the table and also make the format of the birthday a little more clear. I'd probably also add an edit button for each row so you don't have to delete and resumbit the information if you make a mistake.

Study 2: Rivernider
This user didn't really have any issues with the design or make any surprising comments. However based on their actions, I would prevent a user from entering a date in the future.
