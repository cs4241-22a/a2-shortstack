## My Todo List
A very basic to do list with field for user to add a task name and due date.
A dates tills column will be calculated to see how many days left till the due date counting from today.

Using Table layout to store all the database of all the task with task name,dates for due dates and date till as well as delete option for each row.
The Date Tills is the derived column that is computed between the due date and the current date -> the amount of days will appear.
the input due date also check for the date to make sure due date is the future date.

The page is validated!
The page includes:
Server with 3 fields related to the program
a derived field
a result table -> display all data with live update when data is added or deleted
form allow user to Add and delete
Use font Sofia and Roboto
Use a stylesheet style.css file and a javascript

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: the app is a single-page app taht show the form for user to add and delete as well as the current updated state of the server-site data including the dervied data.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: I tested my UI with 2 friends of mine.
Task -> Creates 3 valid tasks and delete one task

Trac
straighforward, put task name in but apparently can't put a due date for today. 
Good error handling with messages and warning.
delete work well
pleasant background and font is on theme
you dont have to scroll and can see everything.

Trac points out that the due date can't be place for today and for todo list, I think it is reasonable for users to set date to current day.
Besides, the exact same entry can also be submitted which I didn't think of. It would be nice to have a checking on entry before adding it to the list to avoid duplication. 


Dang
like how minimalistic it is
self-explainatory
do what it says to do
the color is vibrant and easy to tell what is what
hover on button -> change color
delete fine 
Overall, Dang thinks the UI is decently pleasent with the color theme and how easy to navigate it is sicn eit is very simple.
