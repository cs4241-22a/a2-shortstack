I'm sorry this is late, I was having issues trying to get the VSCode to push to Git and so I had to go through and physically edit each of the files on Github. I know I should have submitted earlier but I was really trying to get the sort thing to work properly. 

## Your Little Library
This application is designed to allow you to record all the books you have in your library. Using whether you've read the book before, and how long ago you acquired it, the library "bookshelf" displays the number corresponding to which book you should read first, with 0 being the first book you should read. 

NOTE: A lot of my code looks like it could have helper functions, but I wasn't sure if I was implementing them correctly so I stuck to just leaving it in the code the way it was, but I tried to add comments throughout to make it more clear what was happening. 

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I created a single-page app that allows users to submit data and see the update state of all the data on the same page. 

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: 
    NOTE: This user was unable to screen record and mic record their session, so I'm including the written feedback they gave me. 

    USER1 Feedback:
    My task given was to create a handful of books with various dates and change whether I've read them of not. Then I need to burn (delete) them all. My first observation before I even submitted any books is that I really like the design of the website, both the color scheme and the layout of the page, along with the font fitting the theme really well. I saved three books into the system, all with different dates that they were acquired on. I then burned all my books to delete them from the system. I like how it shows the ID for the book and you can easily input the ID to delete it. Something small that I think could be changed is some of the text sizes, such as heading one and maybe the text input labels. I think overall the design is good, but those are a couple spaces I can see that may be hard to read and slightly increasing the size may help make the site more accessible.  I think something that could additionally be made more clear was the "read next" field because while the number system is good, it uses zero-based indexing which may only be obvious to those in the Computer Science or tech fields, but I think outside of that it serves its intended purpose. Overall, very good job and I enjoyed testing the website! :D

    My response to feedback:
    - The last name of user1 is Panneton.
    - The user had issues with some of the font sizing. In addition to that, the user suggested changing the start value for the Read Next position from 0 to 1 for people that aren't familiar with 0 based indexing.
    - Honestly I was surprised they liked the color scheme because I didn't have a lot of time to play around with it
    - I would implement both the suggestions they gave.

- **Design Achievement 2**: 
    NOTE: This user isn't in the class and is bad at specifying what exactly they like without looking at the screen to know what they're talking about. And even then it's kinda sparse.

    USER2 Feedback is attached to the repo

    My response to feedback:
    - The last name of user2 is Ushman.
    - The user didn't have any problems with the design, but did enjoy the hover effect and the fact that the bookIDs shifted when one was deleted.
    - I was surprised they were curious whether the table would shift after deletion, but glad they the user was happy it did. 
    - They didn't really give any feedback about problems they had, more just stuff they enjoyed. So while I would make changes, I don't really know what I could specify is based off of their feedback.
