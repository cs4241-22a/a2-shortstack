## Technical Achievements

- **Tech Achievement 1**: It's all on one page! You do need to hit submit to show it when loading the page.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements

- **Design Achievement 1**:
  I had my friend (last name Sandoval-Williams) calculate the number of years since September 7th 1996.
  During her use she tried to use the enter key to submit and it did not work, which she was dissapointed by.
  I was not expecting that to be an issue, so I was slightly surprised by that.
  I would attempt to implement enter key to submit. Otherwise she didn't make many surprising comments.
