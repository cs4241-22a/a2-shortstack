Travelia is a web application where you can store all countries and cities which you visited. First you need to label your list by typing down your name. Then, you can add each destination by using second form with 4 entries including: country name, city name, date when you arrived and days you spent in that destination.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: My single-page application is pretty straightforward and intuitive for any user. I have 2 forms: one for labeling the list with the current user's name, second one is for actually adding the destination to the table. Once the submit button is pressed table will update immediately.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: My UI/UX was tested by two individuals which are my colleagues.

Tester 1: Askhat Zhanabay

Tester 1 Task: Label the list with his name and add 1 destination

Tester 1 problems: No problems where noted

Tester 1 comments that were surprising: He didn't like the styling of the application, he thinks it is too dark.

Tester 1 changes I would make based of feedback: I would change form entries a little so the user will have feeling that he actually submited something.

Tester 2: Batyr Otan

Tester 2 Task: Label the list with his name and add multiple destinations

Tester 2 problems: He couldn't read the entries in the table

Tester 2 comments that were surprising: He enjoyed the color pallete that I used in the application

Tester 2 changes I would make based of the feedback: I will change the table color to white and add some spacing between each row.
