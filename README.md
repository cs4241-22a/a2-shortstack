## TODO List Tracker
Able to add tasks to do in a list to organize your responsibilities. 

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**:
Created a TODO list keeper page by saving the user input and creating a list of TODOs. 
Calculated the start date and end date based on current system time and user input of how long a task is going to take.
The user input is stored in a saparate "server db" and it keeps the list rendering from that db into the page.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: 
Jacob VanStyen:
- Straight foward UI design
- Was little hard to read black on purple
- No complete btn
- Easy to use

Eri Kim
- The middle input field(days to complete) is little unclear at first glance
- Table not alined with input fields
- Do you really need to display "days to complete" if start and end date is already displayed?

# What problems did the user have with your design?
Missing small details such as remove task btn, alignments  between elements, and color choices for easier/more comfortable user experiences.
# What comments did they make that surprised you?
I thought the color was good enough, but the comment saying it was little hard to read was understandable once I saw it in different screens. I realized a color scheme in one monitor could provide very different experience on another monitor.
# What would you change about the interface based on their feedback?
More effort in little details in spacing to make it seem clean.
