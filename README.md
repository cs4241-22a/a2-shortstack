## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: This is a single-page app.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: Tested user interface with 2 students, Jonathan Metcalf and Cole Manning.

Jonathan's feedback: Visual design was good, but there was no input validation (i.e. you could enter negative numbers for seasons, episodes, and lengths of time and leave the show name blank), and the form didn't clear itself upon user submission. I fixed this by adding error messages for invalid form inputs & adding number validation on all the fields.

Cole's feedback: Not much to improve, tested a variety of invalid inputs and it worked fine.
