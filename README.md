## Click Speed Tower
I designed a website that measures your click speed, stores high scores, and compares you to others who have played. You can store your score by typing your name and pressing enter after playing.  You can modify your score by entering the same name (case insensitive) after beating the number of clicks in your previous score.
I used flex to position various elements on the screen as well as the fundamental commands associated with flex. The site was designed with smaller devices in mind, and the page adapts to the screen size.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: The page requests updated leaderboard info with every submission, meaning that the entire utility of the site is contained within one page. 

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: I tested my site with two other students, asking them to submit a score, and then modify it. I then implemented their suggestions.
  - Wecler:
    - The user did not have any trouble using the design of the page.
    - It surprised me that they suggested it might be an issue that they have to start by clicking on the button in the center of the clickbox to start instead of anywhere in the square like consecutive clicks.
    - Suggested that I add more spacing to separate the score box from the leaderboard and the clickbox. The UI has been updated to fix this.
    

  - Barsoum:
    - The user did not have any trouble using the design of the page.
    - It surprised me that the user achieved an above average rating while using the site on mobile.
    - Suggested that the leaderboard automatically ranks scores in order, this has been added.
