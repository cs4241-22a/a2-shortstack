## Erg Workout Logbook
https://a2-ryjdillon.glitch.me/

This application serves as a log to record ergometer (rowing machine) workouts. 
The user will record the date of the workout, the total time that the workout took, 
and the total meters rowed during the workout. The application will then calculate the 
average split during the workout (the average amount of time it took to row 500 meters).
The CSS display method used was flexbox.
