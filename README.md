## Simple Todo App
Task list app. Create new tasks, mark as complete, and delete.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Single page app. Submit button **creates** new tasks. Delete button **deletes** tasks. Checkbox **edits** tasks (marks as complete)
  - Used CSS Flexbox.
  - Derived field of due dat from the priority.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**:
  - Powell, Mason; Yue, Grace
  - Users expressed that the priority (!/!!/!!!) system wasn't super clear. The higher the priority the closer the due date is set. Users expressed that it might make sense if they could set the date themselves.
  - I would probably change the priority feature to just display the priority of the item instead of turning it into a date
  - Users also stated that checking the checkbox should maybe grey out the item so it is more noticeable.
  - One user expressed some error checking could be done on the inputs, such as preventing empty form submissions
