## todo list
Simple todo list - can include a title, assigned date, and due date, but none are required. Used grid positioning. Add button creates new todo item. Delete button is on the right hand side of a todo item.

Todo item's background is based off of the priority of that item. x < 33% of time has passed to the due date = green. 33% < x < 66% = yellow. x > 66% = red.
