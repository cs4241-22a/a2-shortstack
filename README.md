## Watchlist

https://a2-npollock1414.glitch.me/

I created a stock watchlist single page application allowing the user to add and remove stocks from a live updating watchlist.
To add a stock, type its symbol (Ex: AMZN for Amazon Inc.) in the input field and click the "ADD" button. To remove a stock, click the "DEL" button on the right side of the stock.
I used flexbox for the layout of each stock listing.

## Technical Achievements

- **Single-Page App**: Using get and post requests, I was able to sync the client and server data and update the watchlist in real time without refreshing the page.
- **Live Data**: I used the yahoo finance api to get live stock data and historical data for each stock in the watchlist.
- **Charts**: I used the chart.js library to create a candlestick chart for each stock in the watchlist.
