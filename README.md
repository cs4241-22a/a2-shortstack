## Sean McMillan's Name Logger with Character Counter

Link: https://a2-seansta18.glitch.me/

My application is a Name Logger that also counts the characters in the name. Once you input a name, it should show up
on the table on the right with the Index number, a timestamp, the entered name, and the number of characters. To delete a value in the table, start with the keyword "(Delete)" followed by the name you want deleted. For example, to remove a row with my name it would look like "(Deleted)Sean". Make sure there are no spaces between the keyword and the data. I also used the css gridbox method. I had 4 different boxes which included the header, the text section, the submission button, and the table that holds all of the servers data.

## Technical Achievements
- **Using a Single HTML File**: I used a table that updated everytime the submission button was pressed. Each time the submission button was pressed. The script deleted all of the rows from the table then repopulated them based off of the array that was sent back by the server.
