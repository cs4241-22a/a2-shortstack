Include a very brief summary of your project here. Be sure to include the CSS positioning technique you used, and any required instructions to use your application.
I used flexbox to keep the input fields centered and the text in the window. The program takes in three fields and derives an initials field from the first letter/number of each of them.

## Technical Achievements

- **Tech Achievement 1**: I created a single page app that displays the information from the server once the submit button is pressed as well as updating with every subsequent press of it or the delete button in the table.
