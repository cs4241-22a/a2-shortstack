## Your Web Application Title
Include a very brief summary of your project here. Be sure to include the CSS positioning technique you used, and any required instructions to use your application.

I created a ToDo list which takes input from the user and displays their tasks in a table.
the user enters the task, the expected time to complete, and the day it is due. The derived field takes the
ecpected time to complete and multiplies it with the time left before the due date and returns the highest priority task. The user can submit tasks into the table as well as remove them from the table.

Although it was not working correctly, I still had my roommate Ben Watkins test the program. 
The obvious problem that he had with the design was that the table itself does not work. Although this was minorly embarassing for me, he still said that had it worked correctly, he would have found the design user friendly. Based on his feedback, he would like the table to shift directions and be more vertical so that it was easier to read. I agreed with him. 

Likewise, I also had my other roommate Ian Khung try out my project. Like Ben, he was disappointed that it did not work, but said that the instructions were clear. Based in Ian's input, he suggested that I make the table expand when more than 3 tasks are inputted by the user. This is something I would have liked to add to the program.

## Technical Achievements
I was able to implement a form and a table that ideally would have taken the input and returned a derived value. 

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
I was able to use classes to affect the color of different buttons, and the alignment of the text in paragraphs, headers, forms, and the table. I used flex box to aso center items within the screen with jusity-content and align-content. I also imported google fonts into the program.
