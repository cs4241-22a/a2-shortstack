## WPI FOOD RATING

Name: Zach Sarrett
Link: https://a2-zsarrett.glitch.me/

This is a website used to rate what your favorite food choice is on campus.
I tried (and failed) to use CSS positioning. In the repo, there is "image.png", a
picture of what happened when I attempted to use grid.

I have some commented out code in the html of my attempt to create a delete button,
but ultimately I was unsuccessful (code is on line 31, and starting at line 101)

## Technical Achievements

- **Tech Achievement 1**:
  Created a single-page app that provides the user a form to submit data. This data is
  then sent to the server, where it is stored. The server then sends the data back
  to the client side with the updated data, included the derived field of class.
  Therefore, the user is always able to see what is stored on the server side.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements

- **Design Achievement 1**:

1. First person's last name: Smith
2. User accidentally misspelled their name, and since there is no modify/delete function,
   was unable to fix it.
3. They surprised me by commenting on how it would be a good idea to make it a ranking
   system, rather than just picking your favorite.
4. If possible, I would add both a delete function, and also a modify function.

5. Second person's last name: Pfannenstiehl
6. Didn't have any issues with the design, but wanted to be able to do more.
7. Also brought up the idea of making it a ranked/voting system, with last place
   getting 1 point, second to last getting 2 points, etc.
8. I would (if possible) implement some sort of more complex ranking system, that gives
   the user more options than just picking their favorite food choice.
