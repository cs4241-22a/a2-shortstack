## Readme

## Your Web Application Title
My application is a tracker for the characters people own in the game Genshin Impact. Players can input the characters name,
weapon type, elemental vision, and level. Once the user clicks submit the data is sent to a table below and displayed.

## Technical Achievements

- **Tech Achievement 1**: I created a form for users to be able to type in information about a character, and I also created
a datalist for the weapon and elemental sections so users can select from a dropdown rather than typing. The site is single page
and once the user hits submit they can see the data displayed in the table right below. 

### Design/Evaluation Achievements

- **Design Achievement 1**:
1. Ananya Gopalan
2. They aren't able to see the data already in the table when the page is first loaded.
3. They didn't like the color scheme.
4. Based on their feedback, I would change the colors on the page to be more neutral, and I would also try
to make the data display when the page is loaded. 

1. Julie Lee
2. There is no popup when they click to delete the data. 
3. She didn't like the way the buttons looked. 
4. I would add a popup for the delete button to match the submit button so users get confirmation when they delete data.
