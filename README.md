## Technical Achievements

    #1 Single Page web application that can add an assigment with a subject and deadline, with a derived field of 
    priority (high or low) based on if the assignment is CS or not and the name of the assigment being "MQP". The
    current assignments are always dislayed on the websites table and is updated when new ones are added or old ones are
    deleted. Uses a CSS grid and Ubuntu Google Font while using Element selectors, ID selectors, Class selectors




## Design Achievements

    Evaluation #1
    #1 Manning
    #2 The student thought that my input boxes were too square, the page need more padding and margin, and the submit
    button was too plain.
    #3 I was surprised by the student commenting on the submit button, I thought a plain submit button fit the look of 
    website. I thought that since my input boxes were squares the submit button would complement it.
    #4 I would definitely go back and add more padding amd margins to the page. I would also go ahead and redesign the 
    input boxes to be smaller and maybe rounded along with the submit button.
