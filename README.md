## Sean McMillan's Name Logger with Character Counter
My application is a Name Logger that also counts the characters in the name. Once you input a name, it should show up
on the table on the right with the Index number, the entered name, and the number of characters

## Technical Achievements
- **Using a Single HTML File**: Using a JavaScript to update the table each time a new name was entered. I deleted all of the rows within the table then repopulated them using the array stored on the server.
