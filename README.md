Assignment 2 - Short Stack: Basic Two-tier Web Application using HTML/CSS/JS and Node.js  
===

Due: September 8th, by 11:59 AM.

This assignment aims to introduce you to creating a prototype two-tiered web application. 
Your application will include the use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js functionality, with active communication between the client and the server over the life of a user session.

## Kurtz's Cars Automobile Repository
I expounded upon the car example present in the server starter code. My project allows a user to type
their car information into three input boxes representing vehicle year, make/model, and mileage, respectively. This app can be used to 'sell' vehicles to the dealership, or simply compare current inventory with potential new additions. The 'go' button needs to be clicked for information to be logged into the server. 

I thought about altering the CSS positioning, but I found that the default format looked quite respectable.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Using a combination of...
I created a responsive app that uses a form that collects input information about vehicles. The app then sends back a list of vehicles that represent the inventory of my created business. Before any information is inputted, there are already three vehicles that are 'available for sale'. Any submitted vehicles will be inserted after those. The inventory list also calculates the miles driven per year based upon year and mileage data. This is my derived field. Finally, each entry in the list comes with a delete entry button that allows the user to delete vehicles from the inventory. 

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: 
I got a family member to evaluate my U/I. He said that the interactive portions of my application were self-explanatory and easy to use. However, he thought that there wasn't enough space between the header and the entry form. Furthermore, he crticized the lack of explanation around my entry submit button that simply read 'go'. I took both of his points of critique into account and made some changes. For the first point, I added some linke breakages to create some space. For the second point, I added a small header above the form that described what the user would be using the input boxes for.
