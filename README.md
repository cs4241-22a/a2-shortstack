## Your Web Application Title
This is my homework tracker. You enter in the assignment details and it will then be updated in a results table. You can delete the assignment after you finish it.

Examples of my code for a specific css positioning technique (in my styles.css page) for my pages:

    #Title{
        text-align: center;
    }

    a{
        position:relative; 
        left:0px; 
        top:400px; 
    }

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievements**: 
    --> My app keeps track of the data entered (hw assignments) and put it in a table
    --> I use my index.html page as a form to collect all the data 
    --> my results.html page presents all the data collected (you can delete elements in the table)
    --> the user submits data and the server responds by sending back the updated data (including the derived field calculated on the server) and the client should then update its data display.
    --> my derived field is the date and time the assignment was entered 
    --> I completed every technical task
