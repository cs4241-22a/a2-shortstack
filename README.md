## Marathon Rock Paper Scissors
https://a2-s3an0.glitch.me/

This project is a web application that allows users to play Rock Paper Scissors. Users play against the computer, trying to get the highest score possible by winning until the computer eventually wins. Users are then able to submit *one* score to the server data, as well as delete *one* score from the data. Users can replay the game and submit or delete more scores by refreshing the page.

To play, open the webpage and select an option: Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The page will update based on your choice, changing the score, showing your choice, the computer's choice, and if you won, tied, or lost. If you won or tied, you can continue until you lose. Once a player loses, they can type in a name and submit the score. A table showing all the scores on the server will appear. At this point, a user can also type in a name and delete a score from the table, deleting the first score with that name in the table.

The site uses a combination of HTML, CSS, and Javascript to function. For the CSS, the grid layout was used. Specifically, the columns were used to set up the page and its content while rows were used for specific elements such as the placement of the buttons.

## Technical Achievements
- **Single-page App**: Through the use of Javascript and CSS, the site works on one page. Data is submitted through forms by the user and the page updates as a result. The server-side data appears once the user submits their first score, but it stays on the page and updates to match the current data when a user deletes a score.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Tested the User Interface**: Another student from the class helped to test the user interface. Specifically, the student was asked to proceed through the main functionality of the application, including playing the game of Rock Paper Scissors, submitting a score, and deleting a score.

1. The last name of the student who participated in this test was Dias.
2. Problems the user encountered with the design of the interface was the lack of a way within the page to replay the game. Instead, the user had to refresh the page to play again.
3. No comments were made regarding the interface that were surprising. The user understood the interface quickly and no extra instructions were needed.
4. Based on the feedback, it would be best to include a way within the interface to allow for users to replay the game. This gives users a more natural way to replay the game without having to refresh the page.
