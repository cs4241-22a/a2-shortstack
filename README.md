## Todo List Xtreme
My website is very simple To do list that allows the user to add an item, a descritpion, and due date. It will display the item in a table and calculates the remaining days left for the item. You can also clear the whole list. I used a few flex boxes with justify-content to center everything.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: The website is a single page application that updates the table when ever new data is added.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**:

1: What problems did the user have with your design?
    no problems, but he wished there was a individual delete button for each line
2: What comments did they make that surprised you?
    He liked the title
3: What would you change about the interface based on their feedback?
    There's a lot of things I would change given more time. I would fix a few quality of life things such as clearing the inputs when submitting new data. Also making the Ui a little more consistent overall. I would also have liked to add the ability to edit or remove items by line instead of only clearing the whole thing
