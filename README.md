## summary!
todd phillips is not a very good director.
i have not seen all of his films, and i've never seen one i liked very much.
this project aims to determine which films are and aren't directed by todd phillips.
movie title + genre are not case sensitive, but the year of release does matter to determining whether or not todd phillips directed it.
he directed "joker" in 2019, but he did not direct a film called "joker" in 2018.
get your facts straight.

Include a very brief summary of your project here. Be sure to include the CSS positioning technique you used, and any required instructions to use your application.

## technical achievements!
- **tech achievement 1**: using html css and js together, we have got a single page web client that allows users to input their data while displaying the data held in the server.
users can also delete any of the data held in the server freely, using the delete buttons.
it also looks good and beautiful and i think what i did with the cursor is deserving of a technical achievement perhaps.

### design/evaluation achievements!
- **design achievement 1**: user study !
user 1: last name mcfatter (yeah i live with kyle big whoop what about it i live with kyle)
  this user did not have any comments that surprised me.
  they were able to navigate the website without any additional instructions.
  they did comment that the custom cursor makes it a bit harder to know where you're clicking.
  i would ideally change the cursor to have the point where you click not be in the top left corner, since on a circular png the corners are translucent and so you can't actually see where you click.
  however this is a risk i am willing to take.
user 2: last name page
  this user did not have any comments that surprised me.
  they were able to navigate the website without any additional instructions.
  they gave positive feedback on the overall design of the website and thought it looked good
  when pressed to give constructive feedback, they said the sans serif font on the disclaimer and the table was a little plain.
  moving forward, i would consider changing the font, but i did not have much luck finding a better font to embed so i have left it as be.
