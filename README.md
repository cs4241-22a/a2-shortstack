## Worcester Airsoft Tracker!
This tool (made in the artistic style of the early 2000's websites) can help students by allowing them to list
where they have witnessed people using Airsoft equipment so they can plan safer routes.  If Airsoft activity
has never been detected there, the program will say it is an area with little Airsoft activity.  Otherwise, the
program will say it is a hotbed for activity.

To use this app, enter your name and the location you witnessed any suspect activity relating to Airsoft, then click
submit.  The list of other submissions, along with your own, will appear at the bottom of the screen.

Secondly, there is a cybersecurity awareness test that occurs if you hit the very real 'download' button, and a
second test if you hit the bear (that should explain the stylistic choices I made).

I used the 'position' variable and the 'left' (200px) variable in my CSS stylesheet to position my table.  I also
centered the body of my website in the stylesheet using the 'text-align' variable.

## Technical Achievements
I created a single-page app that both provides a form for users to submit data and always shows the current state of the server-side data. To put it another way, when the user submits data, the server should respond sending back the updated data (including the derived field calculated on the server) and the client should then update its data display.
Users can add data.

## Design/Evaluation Achievements
I tested my design with two students: Charlie Snow and Zach Sarret.
Charlie's feedback: "I think the airsoft tracker is awesome and will help with safety off campus.  I think the cybersecurity bear is great because it
teaches you online safety.  I think the colo changing is grating on the eyes and the table looks bad."
Zach's feedback: "This looks like a website from 2001.  Tracking where airsoft assualts happen is neat though.  I did also like your original idea of
a Worcester bear tracker even though that probably would've been useless.  The UI is phenomenal and needs zero changes."  That last part may have been
sarcastic, but hey, I'm a README!  What do I know?
