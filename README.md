*Technical*
- I was able to create a table on the website that displayed the real-time contents of the server. There is a field calculated on the server for the song count, counting how many other people answered that same song. 

## Music Suggestions .com
Include a very brief summary of your project here. Be sure to include the CSS positioning technique you used, and any required instructions to use your application.
- This website gives the users the ability to add or delete fields from the server. They can add their name, favorite music genre, and favorite song. The application than calulates how many other users answered the same song and returns this value in the 'Song Count' feild. If the user decides to delete a field, they can do so by simply entering a name from the table. When an item is deleted, the other 'Song Counts' are decremented accordingly. The website will display the updated server to the user with their changes. 
- The application cannot add to the table at the same time it is deleting from the table.
- CSS: Used 'display,' 'padding.' 'background-color,' 'align,' and 'flex-flow.' All CSS styling is in the style.css file.
