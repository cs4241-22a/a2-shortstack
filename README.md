## Grade Calculator
This a website where you enter your class and scores for the specific assignments, exams, and projects and it will produce your grade for the class. The CSS positioning technique I used was grid.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I used forms for users to submit data. The server sends back the data on same page when i did the e.preventDefault() function in the submit and when i set the action of the forms to ""

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: I talked to two people 
1. Zhu
some comments he made : "The website is very straight forward and easy to use, the design of the website is wonderful. I do not think much should be added to it"
"A user can even use it without instruction"

2. Mehta
some comments she made: "i didnâ€™t have any problems with the user interface"
"only thing i would say is the color is a little jarring but otherwise i like the font and the site is easy to navigate"

The users generally liked my design but Mehta felt uncomfortable with the color I chose for the background. I was a little taken away by that as it felt fine to my eyes. So I'll try to chose some less bright/jarring colors and make a change to my website.
