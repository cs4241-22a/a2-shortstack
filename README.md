This project makes use of front-end JavaScript capabilities to get/fetch data from the server. It is a To Do list that allows you to enter a task, an estimation of how long it will take you (points), and a due date. You can add a task to the list and from there you can edit, delete, or complete a task. Completed tasks will be sent to a different table and can be viewed by pressing the "View Completed Tasks" button.  
This assignment includes all the baseline requirements including
a server with server logic, form entry functionality, results (updated to do list), and a derived field.  
For the design, the project also meets all expectations including CSS positioning/styling of primary elements, various CSS selector functionality, and use of an external stylesheet that is easily maintainable.  

Be sure to include the CSS positioning technique you used, and any required instructions to use your application.  


## Technical Achievements
- **Single Page App**:  both provides a form for users to submit data and always shows the current state of the server-side data
- **Derived Field**: A derived field that estimates the completion date of a task based on the points entered for a task and the current date
