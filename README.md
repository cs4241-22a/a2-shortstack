## Class Data Manager
This website allows users to input class names and IDs, and extracts from the IDs the
class level. It then adds to or edits a list of classes, IDs, and levels, and reports
to the same page of the website a list of the classes and their information. This
list is reprinted every time a new change is made to the data.

In order to use the application, one must input the class name and number into their
respective fields and press the sunmit button. If the class number is unique, a new
class will be added to the list. If the class number is the same as one already in the
list of classes, the older class name will be replaced with this new name.

I used flexbox for the title ("Class Data Manager" in blue) and the description of the 
website in orange, lining them up next to each other.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I have made this application single-page. There are two 
fields in which the user can enter class names and class numbers, and every time the
submit button is pressed, the updated list of classes and numbers is re-printed on the
same webpage. The user can still press the button and continue to reprint the list on
the page after it is initially printed.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: I tested my UI with two individuals; My tasks and notes
for each of them are listed below.

User 1 Task: First, add the class “Webware” with ID 4241. Then, update the class name 
to “Webware: Computational Technology”

User 1 Last Name: Smith

User 1 problems the user had: She wished that the text in the input fields would disappear 
when she went to input information.

User 1 comments that were surprising: The text was a little too small and the orange was a 
little hard to read.

User 1 changes I would make based on feedback: I would make the text in the input fields be 
something that disappeared when the user went to click on it. I would also change the 
font, color, and size of the text on the website to be easier to read.

User 2 Specific task:
First, add the class “Bean Time” with ID 2326. Then, update the class name to “BEAN TIME”

User 2 last name: Goldinger

User 2 problems the user had: She neglected to read the instructions for updating and 
got confused on how to do so until she saw the instructions. She also didn’t like that 
the text in the input fields didn’t disappear when they 

User 2 comments that were surprising: It was very simple but she didn’t notice that there 
were instructions at the top of the page. She thinks the font was too small.

User 2 changes I would make based on feedback: Make the directions more obvious and add the 
word “DIRECTIONS:” to them. I would also increase the font size somewhat.
