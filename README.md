## Todo List
This is a todo list app, on the bottom you can type the name of your task and the date it must be done by. This is more geared towards school assignments as it then derives a priority depending on the difference of the due date and the current time. The app uses flexbox to keep everything centered, and the create task area will always be at the bottom of the page, seperated from the top. I use the Comfortaa font from google fonts.

## Technical Achievements
- **Single Page app**: When a task is submitted to the server, the server responds with the html and the client then inserts the html into the current page, therefore loading everything on one page
