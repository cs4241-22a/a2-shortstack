## WGN - Share your Game Review !

This app is a website for sharing user reviews of any video game played.
Users can manually enter relevant information to enter a game review, 
and the system will generate corresponding recommendations based on the player's score.
Players can browse existing reviews directly by clicking on "see reviews" in the center of the screen. 
Users can also delete their own published reviews.

I use a lot of CSS positioning techniques, including but not limited to: padding, 
margin, margin-left/right/top/bottom, display:flex,align-itms,height,weight,justify-content, text-align,
  vertical-align.
## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: 
I created a single-page app that both provides a form for users to submit data 
and always shows the current state of the server-side data. 
Once the user decides to submit or delete the reviews, the website will automatically refresh the status of the form.
