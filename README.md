## Your Web Application Title
Include a very brief summary of your project here. Be sure to include the CSS positioning technique you used, and any required instructions to use your application.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Achieved a single page application that both provides a form for users to submit data and always shows the current state of the server-side data.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: Asked Shiyue Wang to test out my website. It was finicky in the beginning because of a Glitch server side issue, but once that was resolved Shiyue had what she claimed to be an overall straightforward and smooth experience. All functions that are supposed to work do work, and she liked the anonymity of the data being presented since anyone with the link would be able to access the website. She did point out however that if a user were to incorrectly enter a piece of information, they would then have to delete and resubmit an entirely new form, which is a design feature that I will take into consideration in the future and work on accordingly.
