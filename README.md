Assignment 2 - FlexBook: 
===

FlexBook is a basic "social media" site where a profile can be created using the input fields by either previewing how the profile may look, or submitting it to the larger group of submitted profiles.

The CSS positioning technique used was flexbox usage for the most part, however I ran into issues when trying to format the submitted profiles with varying length of inputs, which made the profile sizes inconsistent. 

The preview would be displayed seperately from the submitted profiles, and can be changed with new inputs just by clicking preview, whereas the submit button will make a new profile for each submission. To clear the input fields quickly, the clear button can be used.
